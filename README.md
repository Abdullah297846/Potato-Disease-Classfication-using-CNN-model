# Potato-Disease-Classfication-using-CNN-model
The objective of this project is to create a robust classification system that employs deep learning techniques to accurately detect and classify various diseases that impact potato plants. 
# Project Overview
In this Project, I have developed a CNN-based model for Potato Disease Classification, focusing on three distinct classes. The model architecture comprises 16 layers, incorporating Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers to extract pertinent features. To enhance training efficiency, techniques like caching and prefetching are employed. The dense layer utilizes the softmax activation function, facilitating probabilistic predictions. Training is performed over 35 epochs to ensure convergence and improved performance. Additionally, data augmentation techniques, such as rescaling, random flipping, and rotation, are applied to address limited data and enhance generalization. This research contributes significantly to the field of automated crop monitoring and disease prevention by providing valuable insights into plant disease diagnosis.
# DataSet
For this project, the dataset comprises images of healthy potato plants and plants affected by three prevalent diseases: 'Potato___Early_blight', 'Potato___Late_blight', and 'Potato___healthy'. The dataset is further divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
